  <h3 class="w3-wide"><i>Biking</i></h3>
  <p class="w3-opacity"> My favorite Hobby is Biking. I love biking for so many reasons. One of the biggest reasons is the positive environmental impact that Biking can have. <a href= "https://climatechange.ucdavis.edu/climate/what-can-i-do/want-to-save-tons-of-greenhouse-gases-bike-it"> according to a professor at UC davis, her decision to bike to work rather than drive resulted in a three ton reduction in her carbon footprint.</a>Additionally, I enjoy biking as a low-stress alternative to driving. When I bike, it feels like I am able to relax and enjoy the world. In contrast, driving is often a frustrating and high-stress ordeal.</p>
  <h3 class="w3-wide"><i> Reading</i></h3>
  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>I also enjoy Reading. My favorite genres are Manga,Science Fiction, and Young Adult. My favorite book currently is Little Brother, by Cory Doctorow.</i></p>
